# String Calculator

A simple string calculator built using **React.js** with **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach. The app supports basic string addition, handling edge cases such as empty strings and invalid inputs. The project is designed to demonstrate a practical use of React and TDD principles.

## Features

- **Simple String Calculation**: Adds numbers from a string separated by commas.
- **Edge Case Management: Gracefully handles empty strings, invalid inputs, and special cases like negative numbers or unexpected characters.
- **Test-Driven Development**: Developed using TDD principles, with tests written first before implementation.
- **React-based Application**: Built using React.js with hooks for managing state.
- **Deployment**: Deployed on [Netlify](https://string-calculator-tdd.netlify.app/) for easy access.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: For fast build and bundling.
- **Vitest**: For unit and integration testing.
- **Netlify**: For deployment.
